            <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>3-4 Large Chicken Breasts</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>2 cloves Garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes (may add only 1/2 teaspoon for less spice)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Sundried Tomatoes (chopped)</li>

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large oven-safe skillet heat oil over medium-high heat.  Season chicken generously with salt and pepper and sear until golden, about 4-5 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to a plate. </li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium heat.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in thyme, red pepper flakes, chicken broth, and heavy cream.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often.  Stir in sundried tomatoes and parmesan cheese.  </li>
            <li>Return chicken to skillet and spoon sauce all over the chicken breasts.  Bake until chicken is cooked through -- about 15-18 minutes.  Garnish with basil and grated parmesan cheese, if so desired. </li>
