        <h2>Fettuccine pasta topped with a homemade rich decadent alfredo sauce </h2>
        <P>There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box and one of them has to be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe.  Years ago, when I was teaching kids’ cooking classes, this was one of the first things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes crazy for alfredo sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never buy the jarred variety again!</P>
        <h2><strong></strong>Tips for making PERFECT FETTUCCINE ALFREDO:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by bringing water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt to the water to season the pasta. Once it is boiling, add pasta and cook according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Saute the garlic and butter together until softened — about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add heavy cream and let simmer over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes to thicken. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth.</li>
            <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
            <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. </li>
            <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use real parmesan cheese, which is refrigerated.</li>
            <li>If you like it to be more "saucy", you may use less than 1 lb. of fettuccine pasta. </li>
            <li>Leftover pasta water may be used to thin out pasta sauce. </li>
        </ul>
